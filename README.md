# how to install
Could you download the latest zip file in the releases and ensure it is the latest one?

Choose where you want to install it, it doesn't matter but I recommend in c:

extract the whole zip file to your selected place

### Great! Now you have it installed what you want to do next is create an environment var to open the exe easily from the terminal.

Open the search in the bottom left of your computer (it could be the bottom right)

Search and edit the system's environmental variables.

Open that then you're gonna see a window of settings.

Don't touch anything you do not need to just follow these instructions:

At the bottom of the window click environmental variables.

You are gonna see a lot of things you do not understand, in the bottom part of the window under system variables find a variable named path and double-click it

this is gonna open a new window with all the paths there    

Copy the path of where you installed the Discord bot manager.

In the paths window click new in the top right then copy your path to the folder where the exe is located. 

Once it's done click ok and you can close all the tabs.

To run it just type in the cmd discordbot.exe

### and boom! You have it installed. 

# How to use it?
The program is self-explanatory but to open the exe all you gotta do is open the command prompt of Windows by searching cmd in the search bar and opening it then typing discord bot in the terminal and the program shall open.
